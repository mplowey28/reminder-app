# user-stories

- I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus onthings that are still pending
- I as a user can specify cost/price for a task or a subtask - so that I can track myexpenses / project cost
- I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that I canshare with my friends - so that I could have separate to do lists for my groceries and workrelated tasks
- I as a user can be sure that my todos will be persisted so that important information isnot lost when server restarts
